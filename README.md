# 3D-Models & Animations

Made by: Aapo Soukkio

## About the repository

Here are some 3D models and animations mostly featuring my hometown, Tampere. These 3D assets were created as a "side product" during the BRIDGE Hackathon in spring 2023. I believe some of them turned out quite impressive, so I wanted to share them here.

There is a folder dedicated to each section of the city that was covered. You can find the animation video there, as well as the .blend file if you wish to enhance the results using Blender.

## Notes

You can find the Blender file **if possible to upload.** This means that GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB.

If the folder doesn't contain a .blend file and you need access to the 3D data, please send me a message. You can find my contact information on my profile.
